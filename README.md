# CPR Report Card App

The pediRES-Q CPR Report Card Application is designed to assist users of Zoll defibrilators with data processing and snapshot analytics. Using the freely available Zoll Rescue Net Code Review software (https://www.zoll.com/medical-products/data-management/rescue-net-fire-ems/code-review/) you can export your data to a .csv format for upload to the application.

This is freely available and you can find it at: https://pediresq.shinyapps.io/CPR-Report-Card-App/

A handy SOP/Instructions on how to interact with the application and pre-process data is available for download on the app.
